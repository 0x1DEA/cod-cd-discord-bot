# Week 2
Welcome to week 2. Last week we created a bot that scanned messages for keywords and replied if it found a greeting. This week we are going to ditch that approach and do things the way Discord wants us to, by registering "Slash Commands."

There isn't much here that can't be learned from reading the code, so I have left extensive comments so that you can go through the program and look at what's changed.

Code can be found at `src/app.js` in this week's directory.

## Things You Need
- Discord bot token
- Discord application ID

Reminder that these are found on the bot management page https://discord.com/developers

If you lost your token, you will need to regenerate it. This will make all previous tokens no longer work so make sure you keep it safe!

## Things to Know
- JavaScript Objects
- Anonymous Functions

## Exercises
- Make your own slash commands
- If you want to go above and beyond, check out the `extras/` directory for an example of a Discord bot that integrates a website UI
